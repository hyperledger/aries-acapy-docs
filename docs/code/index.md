# Aries Cloud Agent Python Code Documentation

Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) is a foundation for building decentralized
identity applications and services running in non-mobile environments.

This is the Read The Docs site for the Hyperledger
[Aries Cloud Agent Python](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python).
This site contains only the ACA-Py docstrings documentation
extracted from the Python Code. For other documentation, please consult the links
in the Readme for the [ACA-Py](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python)
GitHub Repo.

If you are getting started with verifiable credentials or Aries,
we recommend that you start with this [verifiable credentials and agents
getting started guide](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/main/docs/GettingStartedAriesDev).

Want to quick overview of the deployment model for ACA-Py? See
[this document](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/deploymentModel.md).

To investigate the code, use search or click the package links in the left menu to
drill into the modules, subpackages and submodules that make up ACA-Py.

Developers that are interested in what DIDComm protocols are supported in ACA-Py
should take a look at the [protocols](generated/aries_cloudagent.protocols.html) package.
These should align with the corresponding
[aries-rfcs protocols](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/features).
Decorators defined in aries-rfcs and implemented in ACA-Py can be found
[here](generated/aries_cloudagent.messaging.decorators.html).
Some general purpose subpackages that might be of interest include
[wallet](generated/aries_cloudagent.wallet.html) and
[storage](generated/aries_cloudagent.storage.html). For those
agents playing different roles in a verifiable credential exchange, take a look
at the [issuer](generated/aries_cloudagent.issuer.html),
[holder](generated/aries_cloudagent.holder.html) and
[verifier](generated/aries_cloudagent.verifier.html) packages.

Please see the [ACA-Py Contribution guidelines](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python/blob/main/README.md#contributing)
for how to contribute to ACA-Py, including for how to submit issues about ACA-Py.
