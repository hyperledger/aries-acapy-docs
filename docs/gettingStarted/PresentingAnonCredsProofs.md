# Presenting AnonCreds Proofs

Become a verifier, and construct a presentation request, send the request to a
mobile wallet, get a presentation derived from AnonCreds verifiable credentials
and verify the presentation. Run the [Traction AnonCreds Workshop]. Get your own
(temporary -- it will be gone in a few weeks!) Aries Cloud Agent Python-based
issuer/verifier agent. Connect to the wallet on your mobile phone, issue a
credential and then present it back. Lots to learn, without ever leaving your
browser!
